# cutstock.py -- using column generation
#
# Problem Description:
#
# The cutting stock problem in this example is sometimes known in math
# programming terms as a knapsack problem with reduced costs in the
# objective function. Generally, a cutting stock problem begins with a
# supply of rolls of material of fixed length (the stock). Strips are cut
# from these rolls. All the strips cut from one roll are known together as
# a pattern. The point of this example is to use as few rolls of stock as
# possible to satisfy some specified demand of strips. By convention, it is
# assumed that only one pattern is laid out across the stock; consequently,
# only one dimension (the width) of each roll of stock is important.
#
# To run from the command line, use
#
#    python cutstock.py
